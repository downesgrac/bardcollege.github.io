      "The <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical
      Engine</a> has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i>
      anything. It can do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to
      perform. It can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>

    <blockquote>
      "When one swaps "language" with "coding" in this theory, we are abruptly rushed into a scarily possible future. This future is one where all we know is computers and technology, where it consumes us all, like it or not. 
      Alternatively, this could be a statement of the way things are. Both in the earlier sense and the sense that all that we say and emote is code. This all relates back to the acting workshop before viewing The Bacchai, my face can tell you exactly what I'm going to say to you before I can utter a syllable. We understand this because of an unspoken code that humans have made and are naturalized into. We all understand that"less that three" in a heart in this same way. Like coding and emotions, the <3 occasionally needs to be explained, no code is eternally and undeniably understood, but it is common knowledge and will not be dissappearing any time soon."
